# ID-Assignment-1
The project is about a informational website for a mobile game, Punishing Gray Raven. The website would contain information on playable characters, such as ability descriptions, overview of the character, backstory of the character and alternate designs (eg. skins) of the characters. The premise of the game would be shown on the home page of the website.
Character models and profile pictures would be shown together with text along with ability descriptions and logos of the ability

# Design Process
This website is targeted to users who show an interest in playing the game or are already playing the game and would like to know more about the lore of the game or certain effects that the character abilities have on enemies that they face in the game.
